# Homework Week 1

This project reperesents my attempt to create a mobile friendly profile portfolio that I will continue to update as I build more projects.

## Steps

I used Bootstrap and my own css scripting to adhere to the page container and grid.

In order to make the about me page presentable when the screen-size was reduced I made the picture disappear using display= none in the CSS code within the media query.

I also adjusted the :hover settings within the css for the portfolio pictures so that the would stand out before clicked on.

The email form uses buttons and inputs from Bootstrap however currently doesn't work.
